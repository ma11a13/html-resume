<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Maya. I am 15 years old. Even if it's funny, I am in the
   5th grade of secondary school, even though all my classmates
   are already 17-19 years old. I am going to be 16 when I am going 
   to go to the univercity.</p>

<p>I am learnng web design because I want to make a lot of money
   in the future.I am planning to go to the univercity on the
   course called 'Creative Digital Media' where I am probably
   going to learn pretty much the same stuff that I a learning on
   this course with Angela</p>

<p>I am actually writing this and creating this site just as prectice
  and maybe to make my first kind of serious web-site. I really cannot 
  take this work seriously because who is even going to see that?
  Except for me and my friends of course. Well, maybe I am being 
  mistaken and actually someone who is real and serious is going to 
  read all of this and some day in my future I am going to regret I 
  did not take it all seriously. I hope not.</p>

<p>
So that is pretty much it, I actually do not have anything to add
by now, so I am going to say Good bye to my imaginative viewers.</p>
