<h1>The best movies according to Maya's opinion</h1>
 <h2>Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Seeking Amy</h3>
 <p>I watched it with my ex and he was tryna show me some dietals about his feelings and fears through watching this movie but i actually didnt get the point. i just liked it because it was emotional and funny at times, and i was nearly crying at the end.</p>
 <h3>Escorts</h3>
 <p>It was kinda hard and disturbing to watch 'Escorts' as it highlits the real point of it and doesn't show just the pretty image of getting money this way. It shows all the dangerous situations girls can get into because of that kind of job. But i liked it because they weren't hiding behind the standards and were pretty much realistic.</p>
 <h3>Fight Club</h3>
 <p>This is actually one of my most favourite movies. it has a lot of excitement in it, a lot of action and it makes you feel everything. It makes you get attached to the main character and then you got to know he wasn't even real. That can drive you crazy a bit and I like that about that movie. You don't feel the same after watching this, even though it is just a movie </p>
